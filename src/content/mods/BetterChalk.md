BetterChalk is a mod that enhances the chalk experience. Switch easily between tools using T to cycle through options: None, Freedraw, Circle, Square, and Eraser. Use R to cycle through all base game colors! You do not want to be holding chalk when using any tools, instead have an empty slot equipped.
